**These 6 rules are MANDATORY. Violation will break the project.**

Read this in every session (20 seconds). For detailed explanations, see `develop_rules.md`.

## Rule 1: Documentation First

**Purpose**: Prevent unauthorized changes and ensure all work is planned.

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN
- Starting development before documenting the plan
- Making changes without updating documentation
- Using resources not documented in design docs

### ‚úÖ MUST DO
1. Document the plan in design docs (arch.md, ADR, etc.)
2. Get approval from @pm or @user
3. Execute according to documentation
4. Update docs if implementation differs

### Quick Check
```
Before coding: "Is this documented and approved?"
After coding: "Did I update the docs?"
```

**Detailed explanation**: `develop_rules.md` Rule 1

---

## Rule 2: No Unauthorized Resource Usage

**Purpose**: Prevent conflicts, security issues, and unexpected costs.

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN
- Using network ports without approval and documentation
- Installing software/packages without approval
- Using undocumented cloud resources
- Changing database schemas without documentation

### ‚úÖ MUST DO
1. Document resource requirements (ports, packages, etc.)
2. Check availability (e.g., `lsof -i :8081`)
3. Request approval from @arch and @pm
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Use resource ONLY as documented

### Quick Check
```
Before using port/package: "Is it in arch.md?"
If NO: Stop, document, request approval, wait
If YES: Proceed
```

**Resources requiring approval**:
- Network ports (8080-8086, 5432, 6379, etc.)
- External APIs or services
- Third-party libraries or frameworks
- Software installations on host
- Database schemas and tables
- Container volumes and networks

**Detailed explanation**: `develop_rules.md` Rule 2

---

## Rule 3: Frontend Test Resource Management

**Purpose**: Prevent system crashes and CPU overload on low-memory systems.

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Will Crash System!
```bash
npm test               # Uses all CPU cores, exhausts 6-8GB memory
vitest                 # Same problem - system freeze, CPU 100%
```

### ‚úÖ MUST DO - Safe Testing
```bash
npm run test:safe              # Safe: 2 workers, timeouts set
npm run test:safe-verbose      # When debugging failures
```

### Required Configuration

**vite.config.ts or jest.config.js**:
```typescript
{
  test: {
    pool: 'threads',
    poolOptions: {
      threads: {
        maxThreads: 2,        // CRITICAL: Limit to 2 workers
        minThreads: 1,
      }
    },
    testTimeout: 30000,       // 30s timeout
  }
}
```

**package.json**:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:safe": "vitest --run --reporter=dot"
  }
}
```

### Quick Check
```
Before testing: "Am I using test:safe?"
If system has <16GB RAM: ALWAYS use test:safe
If system has ‚â•16GB RAM: Can use npm test, but test:safe recommended
```

### If You Forgot and System Crashed
```bash
# Force kill zombie processes
pkill -9 -f vitest

# Check memory before retrying
free -h

# Use safe command
npm run test:safe
```

**Consequences of violation**: System crash, lost work, hard reboot required

**Detailed explanation**: `develop_rules.md` Rule 3

## Rule 4: Test Before Commit

**Purpose**: Ensure code quality and prevent broken builds.

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN
```bash
git commit -m "feat: new feature (tests TODO)"
git commit -m "fix: bug (will add tests later)"
# Committing with failing tests
```

### ‚úÖ MUST DO
```bash
# 1. Write test first (TDD)
npm run test:safe -- MyComponent.test.js

# 2. Implement feature
# ... code ...

# 3. Run ALL tests (frontend: use test:safe!)
npm run test:safe

# 4. Check coverage
npm run coverage

# 5. Commit ONLY if all pass
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
```

### Quick Check
```
Before commit: "Did all tests pass?"
Before commit: "Is coverage ‚â•70% (frontend) or ‚â•80% (backend)?"
```

### Minimum Coverage Targets
- Backend: >80% code coverage
- Frontend: >70% code coverage
- Critical paths: 100% coverage

**Detailed explanation**: `develop_rules.md` Rule 4

---

## Rule 5: Code Review Required

**Purpose**: Maintain code quality and catch issues early.

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN
- Pushing directly to main branch
- Merging own PR without review
- Ignoring review feedback
- Skipping code review "to save time"

### ‚úÖ MUST DO
1. Create pull request with clear description
2. Link to WBS task (e.g., "Closes BACK-001")
3. Request review from @arch or designated reviewer
4. Address ALL review comments
5. Request re-review if changes made
6. Merge ONLY after approval

### Quick Check
```
Before merge: "Did @arch approve this PR?"
If NO: Wait for review
If YES: Proceed with merge
```

### For Project Managers (@pm)
- **MUST** schedule code review task (CR-XXX) after each module completion
- **MUST** verify @arch updated docs (arch.md, scripts) after review
- See `templates/roles/quick-ref/pm-quick.md` for details

**Detailed explanation**: `develop_rules.md` Rule 5

---

## Rule 6: Security First

**Purpose**: Protect user data and prevent security breaches.

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Security Violations
```javascript
// 1. Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = "sk_live_abc123xyz789";

// 2. SQL injection vulnerability
db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`);

// 3. No input validation
const user = await createUser(req.body);

// 4. Committing secrets
git add .env
git commit -m "add config"
```

### ‚úÖ MUST DO
```javascript
// 1. Use environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

// 2. Parameterized queries
db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [email]);

// 3. Input validation
const schema = Joi.object({
  email: Joi.string().email().required(),
  password: Joi.string().min(8).required()
});

// 4. .gitignore secrets
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

### Quick Security Checklist
- [ ] No secrets in code or config files
- [ ] User input is validated and sanitized
- [ ] SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (output encoding)
- [ ] HTTPS used for all external communication
- [ ] Passwords hashed (bcrypt, argon2)

### Quick Check
```
Before commit: "Did I check for secrets?"
Before commit: "Is user input validated?"
```

**Detailed explanation**: `develop_rules.md` Rule 6
