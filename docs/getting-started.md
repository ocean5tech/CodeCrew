---

## Step 2: Initialize Your Project (5 minutes)

### Option A: Interactive Mode (Recommended for first-time users)

```bash
./scripts/init-project.sh --interactive
```

**The script will ask**:
- Project name: `My Awesome Project`
- Tech stack: Select from the list (or choose "Generic")

### Option B: Command Line Mode

```bash
./scripts/init-project.sh \
  --project-name "My Awesome Project" \
  --tech-stack java-spring-boot
```

### Option C: Core Framework Only

```bash
./scripts/init-project.sh \
  --project-name "My Project" \
  --core-only
```

**What gets created**:
```

---

## Step 4: Create Your First Task (5 minutes)

### Manual Method

1. Open `docs/codecrew/WBS.md`
2. Add a new task under appropriate phase:

```markdown
### BACK-001: Implement User Authentication API
**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL
**Status**: üìã TODO
**Assignee**: @back
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours
**Dependencies**: None

**Description**:
Create REST API endpoints for user authentication (login, logout, token refresh).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] POST /api/auth/login endpoint implemented
- [ ] POST /api/auth/logout endpoint implemented
- [ ] POST /api/auth/refresh endpoint implemented
- [ ] JWT token generation working
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Unit tests with >80% coverage

**Deliverables**:
- AuthController.java
- AuthService.java
- Unit tests
- API documentation
```

### Using Script (if available)

```bash
./scripts/create-task.sh \
  --id "BACK-001" \
  --title "Implement User Authentication API" \
  --assignee "@back" \
  --priority "CRITICAL"
```

---

## Step 5: Use CodeCrew with Claude Code (Advanced)

### Setting Up Roles

1. CodeCrew roles are designed to work with Claude Code's role system
2. You can switch roles using `/role` command:

```bash
# Switch to architect role
/arch

# Switch to backend developer role
/back

# Switch to project manager role
/pm
```

### Example Workflow

```bash
# As Project Manager: Create project plan
/pm create a project plan for user authentication feature

# As Architect: Design the solution
/arch design authentication architecture using JWT tokens

# As Backend Developer: Implement the feature
/back implement the authentication API based on architecture design

# As Test Engineer: Create tests
/test create integration tests for authentication API

# As Project Manager: Review completion
/pm verify all tasks are completed and documented
```

---

## Step 6: Document an Architecture Decision (Optional)

When making important technical decisions, create an ADR (Architecture Decision Record):

```bash
# Create file: docs/codecrew/ADR-001-Authentication-Strategy.md
```

```markdown
# ADR-001: Authentication Strategy

**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Decision Maker**: @arch

## Context

Need to implement user authentication for the application. Options include:
- Session-based authentication
- JWT token-based authentication
- OAuth2

## Decision

Use JWT token-based authentication.

## Rationale

**Pros**:
- Stateless (no server-side session storage)
- Scalable (works well with microservices)
- Standard (widely supported libraries)

**Cons**:
- Token cannot be revoked easily (use short expiration)
- Larger payload than session ID

## Alternatives Considered

- **Session-based**: Rejected due to scalability concerns
- **OAuth2**: Too complex for current requirements

## Implementation

- Use `jsonwebtoken` library
- Access token expiration: 15 minutes
- Refresh token expiration: 7 days
- Store refresh tokens in database for revocation

## Consequences

- Need to implement token refresh logic
- Need to handle token expiration gracefully in frontend
- Will add token validation middleware to all protected routes
```

---

## Step 7: Complete a Task and Create Report

When you finish a task, create a completion report:

```bash
# Create file: docs/codecrew/completion_reports/BACK-001-Completion-Report.md
```

```markdown
# Task Completion Report: BACK-001

**Task**: Implement User Authentication API
**Assignee**: @back
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-10-16
**Time Spent**: 4.5 hours

## Deliverables

- [x] POST /api/auth/login endpoint implemented
- [x] POST /api/auth/logout endpoint implemented
- [x] POST /api/auth/refresh endpoint implemented
- [x] JWT token generation working
- [x] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Unit tests with 85% coverage

## Files Changed

- `src/controllers/AuthController.java` (new)
- `src/services/AuthService.java` (new)
- `src/utils/JwtUtils.java` (new)
- `test/controllers/AuthControllerTest.java` (new)

## Test Results

- Unit tests: 15/15 passed
- Integration tests: 3/3 passed
- Coverage: 85% (above 80% target)

## Code Review

- Reviewed by: @arch
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Comments: Well-structured code, good error handling

## Notes

- Token expiration set to 15 minutes as per ADR-001
- Refresh token logic implemented and tested
- API documentation updated in Swagger

---

**Next Task**: FRONT-001 - Build login page UI
```

---

## Common Tasks

### View Project Status

```bash
# With Claude Code
/pm show project status

# Or manually
cat docs/codecrew/WBS.md | grep -E "(TODO|IN_PROGRESS|COMPLETED)"
```

### Review Architecture

```bash
# Read architecture documentation
cat docs/codecrew/arch.md

# With Claude Code
/arch explain current architecture
```

### Update Development Standards

```bash
# Edit standards
vim docs/codecrew/develop_rules.md

# With Claude Code
/arch add new coding standard for error handling
```

---

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Update WBS regularly (at least daily)
- Create ADRs for all major technical decisions
- Write completion reports when finishing tasks
- Keep architecture documentation current
- Follow the role system consistently

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Mix role responsibilities (e.g., @back making architecture decisions)
- Skip documentation ("will document later" never happens)
- Create tasks without acceptance criteria
- Make technical decisions without documenting rationale
- Ignore the WBS and work ad-hoc

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Can't find templates"

**Solution**: Make sure you're in the correct directory:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
ls docs/codecrew/  # Should show all template files
```

### Issue: "Scripts don't work"

**Solution**: Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Issue: "Claude Code doesn't recognize roles"

**Solution**: CodeCrew roles work as context setters. Use them like this:
```bash
# Set context by mentioning the role
"As @arch, design the database schema"
"Acting as @pm, create a project timeline"
```
