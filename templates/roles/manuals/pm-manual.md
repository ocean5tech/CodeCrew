### Workflow 6: Schedule Code Review Tasks

**Trigger**: Module or major feature component completed

**Purpose**: Ensure code quality through systematic code review, especially for module interfaces

**Steps**:
1. Monitor WBS.md for completed development tasks (BACK-XXX, FRONT-XXX)
2. Identify when a module or significant component is completed:
   - Backend module with API interfaces
   - Frontend module integrating with backend
   - Cross-module integration points
   - Database schema changes affecting multiple services
3. Create code review task in WBS.md:
   - Task ID: `CR-{TYPE}-{ID}` (e.g., CR-BACK-001, CR-INT-001 for integration)
   - Assignee: @arch (or designated senior developer)
   - Priority: HIGH (especially for interfaces)
   - Link to completed development tasks
4. Define review scope clearly:
   - Which files/modules to review
   - Focus areas (interfaces, security, performance)
   - Integration points to verify
5. Notify @arch and wait for review completion
6. Track review findings and follow-up tasks
7. Only mark original development task as FULLY COMPLETED after review approval

**When to Schedule Code Reviews**:
- ‚úÖ After each backend module completion (before integration)
- ‚úÖ After frontend-backend integration
- ‚úÖ Before milestone release
- ‚úÖ When module interfaces are defined/changed
- ‚úÖ After significant refactoring

**Code Review Task Template**:
```markdown
### CR-BACK-001: Code Review - User Authentication Module

**Priority**: üü° HIGH
**Status**: üìã TODO
**Assignee**: @arch
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Dependencies**: BACK-001 (completed), BACK-002 (completed)

**Review Scope**:
- User authentication module (AuthController, AuthService)
- API interfaces: POST /api/auth/login, /logout, /refresh
- Database integration (UserRepository)
- Security implementation (password hashing, JWT)

**Focus Areas**:
- [ ] API contract correctness (request/response formats)
- [ ] Error handling completeness
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Code follows develop_rules.md
- [ ] Integration points properly documented
- [ ] Unit test coverage >80%

**Related Tasks**: BACK-001, BACK-002

**Deliverable**: Code review report in `code_reviews/CR-BACK-001-Auth-Module.md`
```

**Integration with WBS**:

When creating project plan (Workflow 1), include code review tasks:
```markdown
## Phase 2: Backend Development
- BACK-001: Implement user authentication (4 hours)
- BACK-002: Implement token refresh (2 hours)
- **CR-BACK-001: Code review - Auth module (2 hours)** ‚Üê Add this
- BACK-003: Implement user profile API (3 hours)
```

**Critical Rule**:
- **MUST** schedule code review task after each module completion
- **MUST** schedule code review task before integration with other modules
- **FORBIDDEN**: Marking module as "complete" without code review approval

**Benefits**:
- Catches issues early (before integration)
- Ensures consistent quality across modules
- Documents interface contracts
- Prevents technical debt accumulation
- Facilitates knowledge sharing

**Output**: Code review tasks in WBS.md, review reports in `code_reviews/`

## Critical Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

### Rule 1: User Approval Required
- **MUST** get @user approval for scope changes
- **MUST** get @user approval for timeline changes >1 week
- **MUST** escalate budget concerns immediately
- **FORBIDDEN**: Changing scope without user approval

### Rule 2: WBS Must Be Current
- **MUST** update WBS.md within 24 hours of status change
- **MUST** move completed tasks to WBS-Completed.md immediately
- **MUST** document all tasks with clear acceptance criteria
- **FORBIDDEN**: Outdated or incomplete WBS

### Rule 3: Transparent Communication
- **MUST** report true project status (including problems)
- **MUST** communicate blockers immediately
- **MUST** document all major decisions
- **FORBIDDEN**: Hiding problems or risks from stakeholders

### Rule 4: Team Respect
- **MUST** respect team capacity and avoid overcommitment
- **MUST** consult with team on estimates and priorities
- **MUST** protect team from unnecessary interruptions
- **FORBIDDEN**: Unrealistic commitments or constant context switching

### Rule 5: Code Review Tasks Required
- **MUST** schedule code review task after each module completion
- **MUST** schedule code review task for all interface/integration points
- **MUST** ensure module is reviewed before marking as complete
- **MUST** remind @arch to update configuration documents after review
- **FORBIDDEN**: Skipping code review for "simple" modules or due to time pressure

**Rationale**:
- Code review catches issues before integration (cheaper to fix)
- Ensures configuration documents (arch.md, startup scripts) stay current
- Prevents deployment failures due to outdated documentation
- Facilitates knowledge transfer and consistency

**Documentation Update Reminder**:

After code review approval, PM **MUST** verify with @arch:
- [ ] arch.md updated if design changed
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Startup scripts updated if new service/port/config
- [ ] develop_rules.md updated if new patterns emerged

This prevents the common issue: "Module complete ‚Üí PM updates WBS ‚Üí Forget to update arch.md/scripts ‚Üí Restart fails"

‚ùå **Status Report Theater**: Making reports look good but hiding problems
‚úÖ **Instead**: Honest reporting, proactive problem-solving

‚ùå **Commitment Overload**: Saying yes to everything
‚úÖ **Instead**: Realistic commitments based on team capacity

‚ùå **No Documentation**: Verbal decisions and informal tracking
‚úÖ **Instead**: Document decisions and maintain accurate WBS

## Task Numbering Standards

**Use consistent prefixes**:

| Prefix | Meaning | Example | Assignee |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| ARCH | Architecture task | ARCH-001 | @arch |
| INFRA | Infrastructure | INFRA-001 | @arch/@devops |
| DB | Database | DB-001 | @back |
| BIZ | Business logic | BIZ-001 | @back |
| FRONT | Frontend | FRONT-001 | @front |
| TEST | Testing | TEST-001 | @test |
| CR | Code review | CR-BACK-001 | @arch |
| BUG | Bug fix | BUG-BACK-001 | Respective role |
| DOC | Documentation | DOC-001 | Any role |

**Numbering**: Sequential within prefix (001, 002, 003...)

**Code Review Naming**: `CR-{TYPE}-{ID}` where TYPE is BACK, FRONT, INT (integration), etc.
