# ADR-001: Database Selection for User Service

**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Decision Maker**: @arch
**Stakeholders**: @pm, @back

---

## Context

**Background**:
Building a new user management microservice that requires persistent storage for user data, authentication tokens, and user preferences.

**Problem Statement**:
Need to select a database technology that meets performance, scalability, and cost requirements for the user service.

**Forces at Play**:
- Need ACID compliance for user data integrity
- Expected to scale to 1M users in first year
- Team has strong SQL experience, limited NoSQL experience
- Budget constraint: $500/month for database infrastructure

**Requirements**:
- ACID transactions for user registration and updates
- Support for 1000 concurrent users (peak)
- Query response time <100ms for 95th percentile
- Daily backups with point-in-time recovery

---

## Decision

**Selected Option**: PostgreSQL 13 (managed service on AWS RDS)

**Summary**:
We will use PostgreSQL 13 as our primary database for the user service, deployed on AWS RDS with Multi-AZ configuration for high availability.

**Rationale**:
1. **ACID Compliance**: PostgreSQL provides strong ACID guarantees essential for user data
2. **Team Expertise**: Our team has 5+ years of PostgreSQL experience
3. **Cost-Effective**: Estimated $350/month well within budget
4. **Proven Scalability**: Can handle our 1M user target with proper indexing
5. **Rich Ecosystem**: Excellent tooling, monitoring, and community support

## Options Considered

### Option 1: PostgreSQL 13 (AWS RDS)

**Description**:
Relational database with ACID compliance, deployed as managed service.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Strong ACID guarantees
- ‚úÖ Team has extensive experience
- ‚úÖ Managed service reduces operational overhead
- ‚úÖ Excellent tooling and monitoring
- ‚úÖ Rich data types (JSON, arrays)

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Vertical scaling limits beyond 100M records
- ‚ùå More expensive than self-hosted

**Estimated Cost**: $350/month
**Estimated Complexity**: Low

### Option 2: MongoDB Atlas

**Description**:
NoSQL document database with flexible schema.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Horizontal scaling built-in
- ‚úÖ Flexible schema for rapid iteration
- ‚úÖ Great for unstructured data

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå No ACID transactions (at document level only)
- ‚ùå Team lacks NoSQL experience
- ‚ùå Higher cost: $600/month
- ‚ùå Complex query patterns for relational data

**Estimated Cost**: $600/month
**Estimated Complexity**: High

### Option 3: MySQL 8 (AWS RDS)

**Description**:
Popular relational database, similar to PostgreSQL.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ ACID compliance
- ‚úÖ Similar to PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ Slightly lower cost: $320/month

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Less advanced features than PostgreSQL
- ‚ùå Weaker JSON support
- ‚ùå Team prefers PostgreSQL

**Estimated Cost**: $320/month
**Estimated Complexity**: Low

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Fast development with familiar technology
- ‚úÖ Low operational overhead with managed service
- ‚úÖ Strong data consistency guarantees
- ‚úÖ Within budget constraints

**Opportunities**:
- üéØ Can reuse PostgreSQL expertise across other services
- üéØ Future services can share database infrastructure

### Negative Consequences

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Vertical scaling limits (but not an issue at current scale)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher cost than self-hosted option

**Risks**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Vendor lock-in to AWS (Mitigation: Use standard PostgreSQL features only)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cost increase with scale (Mitigation: Regular cost monitoring)

**Technical Debt**:
- None introduced

---

## Implementation

**Timeline**: 2 weeks

**Phases**:
1. **Week 1**: Provision RDS instance, configure security groups, set up backups
2. **Week 2**: Create schema, migrate test data, configure monitoring

**Dependencies**:
- AWS account with RDS permissions
- VPC and security group setup

**Impacted Components**:
- User Service: Will use this database for all user data

**Rollback Plan**:
Can terminate RDS instance if needed during development. No rollback needed in production as this is a new service.

---

## Validation

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Query response time <100ms for 95th percentile
- [x] Support 1000 concurrent users without degradation
- [x] Monthly cost <$500
- [x] Daily backups configured and tested

**Review Date**: 2026-04-16 (6 months)
