**Reddit (r/programming)**:
```
Title: [Show /r/programming] CodeCrew - Framework for AI-Assisted Software Development

I built CodeCrew to solve a problem I had: AI tools like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot are great at writing code, but they don't help with project management, documentation, or quality standards.

CodeCrew provides:
- Role definitions (architect, pm, backend, frontend, test)
- Document templates (ADR, WBS, test reports, code reviews)
- Quality standards and workflows
- Works with any language and any AI tool

It's based on real project experience (95% POC completion) and completely open source (MIT).

Would love feedback from the community!

## 🐛 If Push Fails

### Error: "remote: Repository not found"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Make sure you have access to the repository
# Check remote URL
git remote -v

# If wrong, update it
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ocean5tech/CodeCrew.git
```

### Error: "! [rejected] main -> main (fetch first)"

**Solution** (if repository has content):
```bash
# Pull first
git pull origin main --rebase

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

### Error: "! [rejected] main -> main (non-fast-forward)"

**Solution** (if repository is empty and you want to force):
```bash
# Force push (use with caution!)
git push -u origin main --force
```
